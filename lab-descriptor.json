This lab enables students to experiment with consensus protocols under various failure models (Crash and Byzantine) and distributed transaction standards like the 2-Phase Commit. Additionally, the lab explores peer-to-peer data structures through Consistent Hashing and Chord, providing critical insights into building robust and scalable distributed applications.",
